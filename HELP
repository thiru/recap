recap %s

Realign caption files for better readability (and other caption utilities).

USAGE: recap <command> [<args>]

COMMANDS:

contiguous <FILE>
  Find contiguous, same speaker tags and remove them

fixup <FILE>
  Fixup some common mistakes and follow certain captioning conventions

linger <FILE> [<SECONDS>]
  Extend the time cues appear on screen (allowing viewers more time to read)
  By default up to 2 seconds are added to the end of each cue

overlap <FILE>
  Find overlapping cues in the given caption file

parse <FILE> [<NO-COLOUR>]
  Parse the given caption file and output as an EDN map
  NO-COLOUR
    The output is coloured (syntax highlighted) by default
    Setting this to an any value other than "false" will remove colours

restitch <FILE>
  Join cues for better readability (based on punctuation)

text <FILE>
  Output text contents only (i.e. without timings, and other captions metadata)

trint-dl <srt|vtt> <ID>
  Download captions for the specified document
  ID
    The id of the document in Trint (typically the last component of the URL)

-i
  Read from stdin as the primary input to the respective sub-command
  This is typically the <FILE> argument. For trint-dl it is the <ID> argument.

--help, -h
  Show this help

--version
  Show current version

EXAMPLES

Recap can read from stdin when the -i flag is given
This makes it easy to pipe commands together like so:
  recap trint-dl srt "document id" | recap -i restitch | recap -i linger | recap -i fixup
